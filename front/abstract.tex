\chapter{Abstract}

The Toric code is a well known code for correcting errors on a quantum memory. Until now, all work with the Toric code has had the assumption that errors on the codespace are uncorrelated. The scheme used to correct these errors is optimized for uncorrelated error. In this thesis, I present an improved decoder for the syndrome of the Toric Code, that improves upon the success rate of the code, in recovering from correlated errors. This improvement should lead to helping realize quantum computing earlier, by making them more robust to realistic error models.
